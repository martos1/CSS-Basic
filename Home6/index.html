				<h2>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h2>
				<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg background.
				I used the same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
				<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serius Float Drop when
				I resize (reduce) the browser window. I think is what "display:inline;/* stops IE doubling margin on float"
				is for, but would like further explaination to understand this comment.</p>
				<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div nacessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be seperate version
				wrappers as we have here to contain the different background images? Or parhaps this is an exemple
				of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still confused on that detail.</p>
				<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the left side? I've tried 
				it in all of them, bul it won't budge?</p>
				<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own... it's in the wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be 
				allowing it outside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
